For a long time I decided to create a program that could produce several tokens simultaneously and check their private key and check the data list. I was able to use their performance in this program today with the necessary access. The result was the software that has now been released.

As shown in the image below, the speed of finding and conclusions is much higher than the experimental Trial version. Yes, it is true because in the professional version of this program, all data, including the list of wallets for each coin, receives from the main server of this program and then starts producing a private key with the help of Hexer and the address generated from the private key. Checks with the relevant database that if it is in it, it prints the result to the user and saves in a text file


----------------------------------


Initially, the user was anonymous to maintain anonymous identity.Each time the connection changes and these servers are impossible to repetitive.
